# 🔔 Web Push Notifications Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the Web Push Notifications feature that has been added to the Roomie PWA. The system allows users to receive real-time push notifications when flatmates add new entries, and when their entries are approved or rejected.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend Components

1. **Service Worker** (`client/public/sw.js`)
   - Handles incoming push notifications
   - Manages notification display and user interactions
   - Handles background sync capabilities

2. **Push Notification Service** (`client/src/services/pushNotificationService.ts`)
   - Manages push notification subscriptions
   - Handles VAPID key exchange
   - Provides methods for subscribing/unsubscribing

3. **React Hook** (`client/src/hooks/use-push-notifications.tsx`)
   - Provides a React interface for push notifications
   - Manages notification state and permissions
   - Handles initialization and subscription logic

4. **UI Component** (`client/src/components/notification-permission-card.tsx`)
   - User-friendly interface for managing notifications
   - Shows permission status and subscription state
   - Provides test notification functionality

### Backend Components

1. **Push Notification Manager** (`server/push-notifications.ts`)
   - Handles sending push notifications using web-push library
   - Manages VAPID key configuration
   - Provides methods for different notification types

2. **API Routes** (added to `server/routes.ts`)
   - `/api/vapid-public-key` - Get VAPID public key
   - `/api/push-subscription` - Subscribe/unsubscribe to notifications
   - `/api/test-push-notification` - Send test notifications

3. **Database Schema** (updated `shared/schema.ts`)
   - Added pushSubscription field to User interface
   - Stores push subscription details for each user

## 🚀 Features

### Notification Types

1. **Entry Added Notification**
   - Sent to all flatmates except the one who created the entry
   - Triggered when a new entry is added
   - Includes entry name, amount, and creator information

2. **Entry Approved Notification**
   - Sent to the entry creator when their entry is approved
   - Includes approver information

3. **Entry Rejected Notification**
   - Sent to the entry creator when their entry is rejected
   - Includes rejector information

4. **Test Notification**
   - Allows users to test their notification setup
   - Helpful for troubleshooting

### User Experience

1. **Permission Request**
   - Clean, user-friendly permission request flow
   - Explanatory text about notification benefits
   - Graceful handling of denied permissions

2. **Subscription Management**
   - Easy subscribe/unsubscribe functionality
   - Visual feedback on subscription status
   - Test notification capability

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Works on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Integrated into the dashboard for easy access

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### VAPID Keys

The system uses VAPID (Voluntary Application Server Identification) keys for secure push messaging:

- **Public Key**: Shared with the client for subscription
- **Private Key**: Used server-side for authentication
- **Subject**: Contact information (email) for the service

### Notification Flow

1. **User subscribes** → Client requests permission → Service worker registers → Subscription sent to server
2. **Entry created** → Server identifies flatmates → Push notifications sent to subscribed users
3. **User receives notification** → Service worker displays notification → User can interact (view/dismiss)
4. **User clicks notification** → App opens/focuses → Navigates to entries page

### Error Handling

- **Invalid subscriptions** are automatically removed from the database
- **Failed notifications** don't prevent entry creation
- **Permission denied** scenarios are handled gracefully
- **Network failures** are logged and don't crash the app

## 📱 Browser Support

Push notifications are supported in:
- ✅ Chrome/Chromium (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ Firefox (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ Edge (desktop & mobile)
- ✅ Safari (macOS 13+ and iOS 16.4+)
- ❌ Internet Explorer (not supported)

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Generate VAPID Keys

```bash
npm run generate-vapid-keys
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Add the generated keys to your `.env` file:

```env
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
VAPID_SUBJECT=mailto:your-email@example.com
```

### 3. Database Migration

The User schema now includes a `pushSubscription` field. This is automatically handled by the MongoDB schema.

### 4. Service Worker Registration

The service worker is automatically registered when the app starts. No manual intervention required.

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Open the app in a supported browser
2. Navigate to the dashboard
3. Look for the "Push Notifications" card
4. Click "Enable Notifications"
5. Grant permission when prompted
6. Click "Test" to send a test notification
7. Create a new entry to test real notifications

### Test Scenarios

- **New Entry**: Create an entry and verify other users receive notifications
- **Entry Approval**: Approve an entry and verify the creator receives notification
- **Entry Rejection**: Reject an entry and verify the creator receives notification
- **Multiple Users**: Test with multiple user accounts
- **Permission Denied**: Test behavior when permission is denied
- **Offline/Online**: Test notification behavior in different network conditions

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **VAPID Private Key**: Keep secure, never expose publicly
2. **Subscription Data**: Stored securely in the database
3. **Permission Handling**: Respects user privacy choices
4. **Error Logging**: Sensitive information is not logged

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Notifications not working**
   - Check browser support
   - Verify VAPID keys are correctly configured
   - Ensure user has granted permission
   - Check browser notification settings

2. **Service Worker issues**
   - Check browser developer tools for errors
   - Verify service worker is registered
   - Clear browser cache and reload

3. **Subscription failures**
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify server is running
   - Check browser console for errors

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging by opening browser developer tools and monitoring:
- Console logs (service worker and main thread)
- Network requests to push notification endpoints
- Application tab → Service Workers

## 📈 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the push notification system:

1. **Notification Categories**: Different notification types with user preferences
2. **Scheduled Notifications**: Reminders for bill payments, etc.
3. **Rich Notifications**: Images, action buttons, progress indicators
4. **Notification History**: Track and display past notifications
5. **Smart Notifications**: ML-based notification timing optimization
6. **Cross-Platform**: Native mobile app integration

## 📚 Code Examples

### Sending Custom Notifications

```typescript
// Send a custom notification
await pushNotificationManager.sendToUser(userId, {
  title: 'Custom Notification',
  body: 'This is a custom message',
  icon: '/icon.png',
  data: { customData: 'value' }
});
```

### Checking Subscription Status

```typescript
// Check if user is subscribed
const { isSubscribed } = usePushNotifications();
if (isSubscribed) {
  // User will receive notifications
}
```

### Handling Notification Clicks

```typescript
// In service worker
self.addEventListener('notificationclick', (event) => {
  // Handle notification interaction
  const data = event.notification.data;
  // Navigate to specific page based on data
});
```

## 🎯 Success Metrics

The push notification implementation should achieve:

- **High Adoption**: >70% of users enable notifications
- **Low Unsubscribe Rate**: <10% unsubscribe rate
- **Improved Engagement**: Increased app usage after notifications
- **Reduced Response Time**: Faster response to entries and approvals

---

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly push notification system that enhances the Roomie app experience by keeping users informed about important activities in their shared living space.
